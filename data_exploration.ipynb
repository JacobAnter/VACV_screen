    "Questions to ask Artur:\n",
    "1.) The two columns \"ID_openBIS\" and \"PublicationLink_material\"\n",
    "consistently use the name \"SCRAMBLED\", whereas the column \"Name\" uses\n",
    "both \"SCRAMBLED\" and \"ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting Pool\" for this control\n",
    "type; are they the same? Apart from that, according to the alternative\n",
    "name of \"SCRAMBLED\", the scrambled siRNAs consist of both targeting and\n",
    "non-targeting siRNAs. This, however, contradicts what Artur told me\n",
    "about the scrambled siRNAs, namely that they are entirely comprised of\n",
    "non-targeting siRNAs. -> ...\n",
    "2.) In the case of the kinome controls, the feature \"siRNA_number\"\n",
    "consistently has the value 1, probably indicating that one single type\n",
    "of siRNA was used. However, on scrutinising the feature\n",
    "\"Sequences_sense_5_3\", it becomes apparent that multiple siRNA sequences\n",
    "(4) are listed, thereby contradicting the value for \"siRNA_number\". The\n",
    "precise amnount of siRNAs is not mentioned in the manuscript either. So\n",
    "how many siRNAs were employed for the individual controls? -> According\n",
    "to the product information provided by Dharmacon, the term \"SMARTpool\",\n",
    "which we also have here, indicates that a mixture of 4 siRNAs provided\n",
    "as a single reagent were employed. While actually 4 individual\n",
    "siRNAs have been employed, one single reagent comprising these 4 siRNAs\n",
    "has been used. Hence, the value 1 of the feature \"siRNA_number\"\n",
    "presumably refers to the single reagent comprising the 4 individual\n",
    "siRNAs rather than to the 4 different siRNAs themselves.\n",
    "3.) Speaking of siRNAs, the letter \"u\" probably represents overhang\n",
    "nucleotides, doesn't it?\n",
    "4.) The feature \"REPLICATE\" has the unique values 1 and 2, indicating\n",
    "that only duplicates instead of triplicates have been made; is that\n",
    "correct? -> indicates biological replicate\n",
    "5.) From the feature \"Experiment\", it emerges that many of the\n",
    "individual experiments have been performed twice, corrobotaring the\n",
    "assumption that merely duplicates instead of triplicates have been made.\n",
    "But what do the individual experiment names mean? Apart from that, there\n",
    "are two experiments for which no duplicate seems to have been performed,\n",
    "they are VACCINIA-DU-K1 and VACCINIA-QU-K1. -> just come to terms with\n",
    "it\n",
    "6.) What is the meaning behind the following features:\n",
    "Sequence_antisense_5_3_MD5,\n",
    "Ensembl_ID_OnTarget_NCBI_HeLa_phs000643_v3_p1_c1_HMB,\n",
    "ID_OnTarget_NCBI_HeLa_phs000643_v3_p1_c1_HMB,\n",
    "RefSeq_ID_OnTarget_RefSeq_20170215, ID_OnTarget_RefSeq_20170215,\n",
    "Ensembl_ID_OnTarget_Ensembl_GRCh38_release_87,\n",
    "ID_OnTarget_Ensembl_GRCh38_release_87,\n",
    "ID_OnTarget_Merge, ID_OnTarget_Intersection, Precursor_Accession,\n",
    "Precursor_Name. -> ignore for now; look like particular databases; they\n",
    "will be usefule at a later point\n",
    "7.) For many wells, the Z-scored values are Nan although the respective\n",
    "non-standardised values are different from NaN. I have to subject this\n",
    "to further scrutiny! -> Chequerboard is not icluded in Z' score\n",
    "computation, hence the value NaN!\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes for me:\n",
    "1.) \"ARAC\" is equivalent to \"Cytosine Arabinoside - incorporates into\n",
    "DNA and inhibits DNA replication\".\n",
    "2.) Experiments have been conducted in 384 well plates. Hence, the wells\n",
    "range from A1 to P24.\n",
    "3.) Apparently, two 384 well plates were employed for the first\n",
    "experiment, which is suggested by the following observations: The\n",
    "experiment VACCINIA-DP-K1 encompasses 768 rows, which equals exactly\n",
    "twice the amount of wells a single 384 well plate has. For each of those\n",
    "rows, the feature \"REPLICATE\" has the value 1. Note that as the first row is\n",
    "populated by the feature names, the experiment VACCINIA-DP-K1 ranges\n",
    "from row 2 to 769. Accordingly, the second replicate of the first\n",
    "experiment, VACCINIA-DP-K2, ranges from row 770 to 1537. For those 768\n",
    "rows, the feature \"REPLICATE\" has the value 2, indicating that they are\n",
    "a technical replicate of the first 768 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment VACCINIA-QU, however, seems to involve three 384 well\n",
    "plates, as the first replicate, VACCINIA-QU-K1, ranges from 1538 to\n",
    "2.689, which equals 3 times 384. The feature \"REPLICATE\" has the value\n",
    "1. Accordingly, the second replicate of the second experiment,\n",
    "VACCINIA-QU-K2, ranges from ... to .... For those ... rows, the feature ...\n",
